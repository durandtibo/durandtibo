## Hi, I’m Thibaut 🐻

My name is pronounced like "Tibo". 

I'm currently a Staff Machine Learning Researcher at RBC Borealis (formerly Borealis AI) in Vancouver, BC, Canada, where I work at the intersection of ML and finance, creating intelligent and human-centered systems that bring meaningful change to the future of banking. 
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Simon Fraser University, working under the supervision of Greg Mori. 
I earned my PhD from Sorbonne University in Paris, France, where I was advised by Matthieu Cord and Nicolas Thome.

I enjoy coding, and this profile features a collection of code from my side projects. 
Most of it is directly or indirectly related to machine learning.
You can learn more about me on [my website 🌐](https://durandtibo.github.io/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn 👥](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaut-durand-60568162/). 
You can reach me via the email listed on my GitHub profile. 
I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. 

When I’m not deep in code or research papers, I’m probably chasing a ball (basketball 🏀 or volleyball 🏐), running for fun 🏃 (or from bugs), hiking up a mountain ⛰️, or buried in a book 📖. 
Also, I think bears 🐻 are awesome.
