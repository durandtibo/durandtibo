## Hi, I’m Thibaut 🐻

My name is pronounced like "Tibo". 

I'm based in Vancouver, BC, Canada 🇨🇦. 
I'm a Staff Machine Learning Researcher at [RBC Borealis](https://rbcborealis.com/) (formerly Borealis AI), where I work at the intersection of ML and finance, creating intelligent and human-centered systems that bring meaningful change to the future of banking. 
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), working under the supervision of [Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/). 
I earned my PhD from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in Paris, France, where I was advised by [Matthieu Cord](https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/) and [Nicolas Thome](https://thome.isir.upmc.fr/).

I enjoy coding, and this profile features a collection of code from my personal side projects. 
Most of it is directly or indirectly related to machine learning. 
I am particularly interested in developing better pipelines for training and evaluating machine learning models. 
In my experience, flexibility and efficiency are critical for rapid experimentation and iteration, which are essential when designing and improving new ML models or algorithms.
I do most of my coding in Python, and PyTorch is my favourite deep learning library. 

You can learn more about me on [my website 🌐](https://durandtibo.github.io/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn 👥](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaut-durand-60568162/). 
You can reach me via the email listed on my GitHub profile. 
I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. 
When I’m not deep in code or research papers, I’m probably chasing a ball (basketball 🏀, volleyball 🏐, or a rogue birdie 🏸), running for fun 🏃 (or from bugs), hiking up a mountain ⛰️, or buried in a book 📖. 
Also, I think bears 🐻 are awesome.
